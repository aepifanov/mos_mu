Limitations
===========

The Mirantis OpenStack 9.0 or 9.1 to 9.2 update procedure has the
following limitations:

* Only Ubuntu-based Mirantis OpenStack update is supported.
* The files of patches generated by the ``mos-mu`` playbook have absolute
  target paths. Therefore, if you want to apply your own patch during the
  update, this patch should also have an absolute path.
* The detection of customizations in plugins is not supported.
* The update procedure was only tested with the following Fuel plugins
  enabled: StackLight, Contrail, Murano, and LDAP.
* If your environment has the StackLight InfluxDB-Grafana plugin for Fuel,
  update the plugin to version 0.10.3 before updating your Mirantis OpenStack
  to 9.2.
